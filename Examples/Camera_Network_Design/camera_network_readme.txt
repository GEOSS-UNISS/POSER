Here we show how the camera network may be more important than the choice of the proper camera model formulation (implicit vs explicit modelling of refraction).
A single strip made of nadir looking only images is not appropriate for self calibration in a SfM approach and delivers inaccurate results with an evident bent of the 3D reconstructed object. 
In this example we show that the inclusion of an additional strip of oblique images breaks the correlations between interior and exterior orientation parameters providing significantly better accuracy.
The practictioners can experiment the accuracy degradation according to the flat to EP distance and simulate whether it fits the accuracy requirement of their application of interest.

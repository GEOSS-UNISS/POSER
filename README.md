# POSER
an oPen sOurce Simulation platform for tEaching and tRaining underwater photogrammetry

POSER is an open-source platform designed to teach and train the fundamentals of underwater photogrammetry. It is funded by the ISPRS Educational and Capacity Building Initiatives and developed using Blender. The platform provides a scientifically sound and user-friendly environment for learning and experimentation, targeting students and researchers in marine archaeology, ecology, and subsea metrology.

### Learning by Doing with POSER

Simulation-based learning in POSER helps in acquiring complex skills, bridging the gap between theory and practical application.

### 1. Water Turbidity and Influence on Image Contrast

In underwater photogrammetry, water turbidity significantly impacts image contrast due to light absorption and scattering, reducing spatial resolution and observation accuracy. POSER uses Blender's volumetric rendering to simulate these effects, allowing users to experience and understand the challenges of underwater imaging.

#### 2. Imaging Basics in Underwater Photogrammetry

Learn about image scale, ground sample distance (GSD), and how to achieve specific levels of detail in recorded scenes. Interactive exercises allow students to modify camera distance and check the achieved GSD using metric resolution targets.

#### 3. Underwater Camera Calibration

Practice camera calibration using various objects, analyze image quality based on the system used (dome, flat, or cylindrical ports), and evaluate the impact of the camera network on calibration accuracy.

#### 4. Accuracy Degradation due to Unmodeled Refractive Effects

Understand the impact of flat ports and uncentered dome ports on systematic errors. Exercises demonstrate the resulting 3D deformations and the importance of modeling these effects.

#### 5 Refraction by Waves and Water Caustics in Underwater and Through Water Applications

Simulate underwater scenarios with caustics, both underwater and through water, as seen when using a UAV in shallow water. Practice image orientation under varying conditions and test different caustics removal algorithms.

#### 6. SCUBA Diver-Operated Surveys: Training Safety During Underwater Photogrammetry Surveys

Understand the impact of increased pressure underwater, including inert gas dissolution in tissues and the limitations of non-decompression limits (NDL). POSER allows for the export of dive profiles, which can be analyzed using dive logging software such as Subsurface.
